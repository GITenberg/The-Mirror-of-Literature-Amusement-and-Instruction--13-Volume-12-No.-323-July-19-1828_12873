We have hitherto been silent spectators of these grandstrides in the intellectual advancement of our country; but we havenot, on that account, been less sensible of the important benefitswhich they are calculated to work in her social scheme, and in </p><blockquote><p> The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.</p></blockquote><p> We are not of those who would (even were Newton&rsquo;s theorypracticable) compress the world into a nutshell, or neglect &ldquo;aughttoward the general good;&rdquo; and one of our respected correspondents,who doubtless participates in these cosmopolitan sentiments, hasfurnished us with the original of the above view of COLOMBIACOLLEGE; seeing that this, like the universities of our own country,is equally important to &ldquo;Prince Posterity,&rdquo; and accordinglywe proceed with our correspondent&rsquo;s description. </p><p> Colombia College, in the city of New York (of the principalbuilding of which the annexed sketch is a correct representation)may be ranked among the chief seminaries of learning in America. Itwas principally founded by the voluntary contributions of theinhabitants of the province, assisted by the general assembly andcorporation of Trinity Church, in 1754; at which time it was calledKing&rsquo;s College. </p><p> A royal charter, and grant of money, was obtained, incorporatinga number of gentlemen therein mentioned, by the name of &ldquo;TheGovernors of the College of the province of New York, in the City ofNew York;&rdquo; and granting to them and their successors for ever,among various other rights and privileges, the power of conferringsuch degrees as are usually conferred <span class="pagenum"><aid="page34" name="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>by the Englishuniversities. The president and members to be of the church ofEngland, and the form of prayer used to be collected from theLiturgy of the church of England. </p><p>Since the revolution, the legislature passed an act, constitutingtwenty-one gentlemen, (of whom were the governor andlieutenant-governor for the time being,) a body corporate andpolitic, by the name of &ldquo;the Regents of the University of the stateof New York.&rdquo; They were entrusted with the care of the literature ofthe state, and a power to grant charters for erecting colleges andacademies throughout the state.</p><p>It received the name of Colombia College in 1787; when by an actof the legislature, it was placed under the care of twenty-fourgentlemen, styled, &ldquo;the trustees of the Colombian College,&rdquo; whopossessed the same powers as those of King&rsquo;s College.</p><p>In 1813, the College of Physicians and the Medical School wereunited; and the academical and medical departments are togetherstyled &ldquo;The University of New York.&rdquo; It is now well endowed andliberally patronized by the legislature of the state. The Collegeconsists of two handsome stone edifices, but the view given is butone-third of the originally intended structure, and contains achapel, hall, library of 5,000 volumes, museum, anatomical theatre,and school for experimental philosophy.</p><p>The Medical College is a large, brick building, containing ananatomical museum, chemical laboratory, mineralogical cabinet,museum of natural history, and a botanical garden, and nine medicalprofessors. Every student pays to each professor from 15 to 25dollars per course.</p><p>There are also professors of mathematics, natural philosophy,history, ancient and modern languages, logic, &amp;c. The number ofstudents in 1818 was 233, but it has now greatly increased. As manyin each year as finish their course of study, walk in processionwith the other students and all the professors, preceded by a bandof music to St. Paul&rsquo;s church, where they deliver orations inEnglish and Latin before a crowded assembly. This is called &ldquo;acommencement.&rdquo;</p><p>The situation is about 150 yards from the Hudson, of which, andthe surrounding country it commands an extensive view. The whole isenclosed by a stone wall, with an area of several acres,interspersed with gravel walks, green plats, and full-grown trees.</p><p>BETA.</p><div class="note"><p><i>Note</i>.&mdash;All our readers may not be aware that theremains of Two Literary Colleges still exist in London: <i>GreshamCollege</i> and <i>Sion College</i>&mdash;or we should say of one ofthem. The first was founded and endowed by that excellent citizenSir Thomas Gresham. He was much opposed by the university ofCambridge, which endeavoured to prevent the establishment of a rivalinstitution. (This was two centuries and a half ago.) He devised bywill, his house in Bishopsgate street, to be converted intohabitations and lecture-rooms for seven professors or lecturers onseven liberal sciences, who were to receive a salary out of therevenues of the Royal Exchange. Gresham College was subsequentlyconverted into the modern general excise-office; but <i>theplaces</i> are still continued, with a double salary for the loss ofapartments, and the lectures are delivered gratuitously twice a dayin a small room in the Royal Exchange, during term-time. The will ofthe founder has not, however, been actually carried into execution.As we hate &ldquo;solemn farce&rdquo; and &ldquo;ignorance in stilts,&rdquo; we hope&ldquo;scrutiny will not be stone blind&rdquo; in this matter. A more useful manthan Sir Thomas Gresham is not to be found in British biography, andit is painful to see his good intentions frustrated.</p><p><i>Sion College</i> is situated near London Wall, to the south ofFore-street. It was founded in 1623 by the rector of St.Dunstan&rsquo;s in the west, for the London clergy. The whole bodyof rectors and vicars within the city are fellows of this college,and all the clergy in and near the metropolis may have free accessto its extensive and valuable library.</p></div><br /><hr /><br /><h2>SUPERSTITIONS ON THE WEATHER.</h2><p class="centre"><big><i>From Sir H. Davy&rsquo;s Salmonia; or, Days of Fly-fishing.(In Conversations.)</i></big></p><blockquote class="note">POIETES, a Tyro in Fly-fishing.&mdash;PHYSICUS, an uninitiatedAngler, fond of inquiries in natural history, &amp;c.&mdash;HALIEUS,an accomplished fly-fisher.&mdash;ORNITHER, a sportinggentleman.</blockquote><p><i>Poietes</i>. I hope we shall have another good day to-morrow,for the clouds are red in the west.</p><p><i>Physicus</i>. I have no doubt of it, for the red has a tint ofpurple.</p><p><i>Halieus</i>. Do you know why this tint portends fineweather?</p><p><i>Phys</i>. The air, when dry, I believe, refracts more red, orheat-making rays; and as dry air is not perfectly transparent, theyare again reflected in the horizon. I have generally observed acoppery or yellow sun-set to foretell rain; but, as an indication ofwet weather approaching, nothing is more certain than a halo roundthe moon, which is produced by the precipitated water; and thelarger the circle, the nearer the clouds, and consequently the moreready to fall.</p><p><i>Hal</i>. I have often observed that the old proverb iscorrect&mdash;</p><div class="poem"><p>A rainbow in the morning is the shepherd&rsquo;s warning:</p><p>A rainbow at night is the shepherd&rsquo;s delight.</p></div><p>Can you explain this omen?</p><p><i>Phys</i>. A rainbow can only occur when the clouds containingor depositing the rain are opposite to the sun,&mdash;and in theevening the rainbow is in the east, and in the morning in the west;and as our<span class="pagenum"><a id="page35" name="page35"></a>[pg35]</span>heavy rains in this climate are usually brought by the westerlywind, a rainbow in the west indicates that the bad weather is on theroad, by the wind, to us; whereas the rainbow in the east provesthat the rain in these clouds is passing from us.</p><p><i>Poiet</i>. I have often observed, that when the swallows flyhigh, fine weather is to be expected or continued; but when they flylow, and close to the ground, rain is almost surely approaching. Canyou account for this?</p><p><i>Hal</i>. Swallows follow the flies and gnats, and flies andgnats usually delight in warm strata of air; and as warm air islighter, and usually moister, than cold air, when the warm strata ofair are high, there is less chance of moisture being thrown downfrom them by the mixture with cold air; but when the warm and moistair is close to the surface, it is almost certain that, as the coldair flows down into it, a deposition of water will take place.</p><p><i>Poiet</i>. I have often seen sea-gulls assemble on the land,and have almost always observed that very stormy and rainy weatherwas approaching. I conclude that these animals, sensible of acurrent of air approaching from the ocean, retire to the land toshelter themselves from the storm.</p><p><i>Ornither</i>. No such thing. The storm is their element; andthe little petrel enjoys the heaviest gale, because, living on thesmaller sea-insects, he is sure to find his food in the spray of aheavy wave&mdash;and you may see him flitting above the edge of thehighest surge. I believe that the reason of this migration ofsea-gulls, and other sea-birds, to the land, is their security offinding food; and they may be observed, at this time, feedinggreedily on the earth-worms and larva, driven out of the ground bysevere floods: and the fish, on which they prey in fine weather inthe sea, leave the surface and go deeper in storms. The search afterfood is the principal cause why animals change their places. Thedifferent tribes of the wading birds always migrate when rain isabout to take place; and I remember once, in Italy, having been longwaiting, in the end of March, for the arrival of the double snipe inthe Campagna of Rome, a great flight appeared on the 3rd of April,and the day after heavy rain set in, which greatly interfered withmy sport. The vulture, upon the same principle, follows armies; andI have no doubt that the augury of the ancients was a good dealfounded upon the observation of the instincts of birds. There aremany superstitions of the vulgar owing to the same source. Foranglers, in spring, it is always unlucky to see singlemagpies,&mdash;but two may be always regarded as a favourable omen;and the reason is, that in cold and stormy weather, one magpie aloneleaves the nest in search of food, the other remaining sitting uponthe eggs or the young ones; but when two go out together, it is onlywhen the weather is warm and mild, and favourable for fishing.</p><p><i>Poiet</i>. The singular connexions of causes and effects, towhich you have just referred, make superstition less to be wonderedat, particularly amongst the vulgar; and when two facts naturallyunconnected, have been accidentally coincident, it is not singularthat this coincidence should have been observed and registered, andthat omens of the most absurd kind should be trusted in. In the westof England, half a century ago, a particular hollow noise on thesea-coast was referred to a spirit or goblin, called Bucca, and wassupposed to foretell a shipwreck: the philosopher knows that soundtravels much faster than currents in the air, and the sound alwaysforetold the approach of a very heavy storm, which seldom takesplace on that wild and rocky coast without a shipwreck on some partof its extensive shores, surrounded by the Atlantic.</p><p><i>Phys</i>. All the instances of omens you have mentioned arefounded on reason; but how can you explain such absurdities asFriday being an unlucky day, the terror of spilling salt, or meetingan old woman? I knew a man of very high dignity, who was exceedinglymoved by these omens, and who never went out shooting without abittern&rsquo;s claw fastened to his button-hole by a riband, whichhe thought ensured him good luck.</p><p><i>Poiet</i>. These, as well as the omens of death-watches,dreams, &amp;c., are for the most part founded upon some accidentalcoincidences; but spilling of salt, on an uncommon occasion, may, asI have known it, arise from a disposition to apoplexy, shown by anincipient numbness in the hand, and may be a fatal symptom; andpersons, dispirited by bad omens, sometimes prepare the way for evilfortune; for confidence in success is a great means of ensuring it.The dream of Brutus, before the field of Pharsalia, probablyproduced a species of irresolution and despondency, which was theprincipal cause of his losing the battle: and I have heard that theillustrious sportsman to whom you referred just now, was alwaysobserved to shoot ill, because he shot carelessly, after one of hisdispiriting omens.</p><p><i>Hal</i>. I have in life met with a few<span class="pagenum"><a id="page36" name="page36"></a>[pg36]</span>coincidences or by natural connexions; and I have known minds of avery superior class affected by them,&mdash;persons in the habit ofreasoning deeply and profoundly.</p><p><i>Phys</i>. In my opinion, profound minds are the most likely tothink lightly of the resources of human reason; and it is the pert,superficial thinker, who is generally strongest in every kind ofunbelief. The deep philosopher sees chains of causes and effects sowonderfully and strangely linked together, that he is usually thelast person to decide upon the impossibility of any two series ofevents being independent of each other; and in sciences, so manynatural miracles, as it were, have been brought to light,&mdash;suchas the fall of stones from meteors in the atmosphere, the disarmingof a thunder-cloud by a metallic point, the production of fire fromice by a metal white as silver, and referring certain laws of motionof the sea to the moon,&mdash;that the physical inquirer is seldomdisposed to assert, confidently, on any abstruse subjects belongingto the order of natural things, and still less so on those relatingto the more mysterious relations of moral events and intellectualnatures.</p><br /><hr /><br /><h2>DEVIL&rsquo;S HOLE, KIRBY STEPHEN.</h2><p class="centre"><big>(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</big></p><p>At about three quarters of a mile east of Kirby Stephen,Westmoreland, is a bridge of solid rock, known by the name of<i>Staincroft Bridge</i> or Stonecroft Bridge, under which runs asmall but fathomless rivulet. The water roars and gushes through thesurrounding rocks and precipices with such violence, as almost todeafen the visitor. Three or four yards from the bridge is animmense abyss, where the waters &ldquo;incessantly roar,&rdquo; which goes bythe name of <i>Devil&rsquo;s Hole</i>; the tradition of which is, that twolovers were swallowed up in this frightful gulf. The neighbouringpeasants tell a tale of one <i>Deville</i>, a lover, who, throughrevenge, plunged his fair mistress into these waters, and afterwardsfollowed her. How far this story may get belief, I know not; butsuch they aver is the truth, while they mournfully lament the sadaffair.&mdash;They point out a small hole in the bank where you may hearthe waters dashing with fury against the projecting rocks. This,some imagine to be the noise of infernal spirits, who have taken uptheir abode in this tremendous abyss; while others persist in theiropinion, that the lover&rsquo;s name was <i>Deville</i>, and that itretains his name to this day, in commemoration of the horrid deed.</p><p>I have seen, and taken a view of the frightful place, which mayrather be imagined than described. One part of the water wasformerly so narrow, that a wager was laid by a gentleman that hecould span it with the thumb and little finger, and which he wouldhave accomplished, but his adversary, getting up in the night time,chipped a piece off the rock with a hammer, and thus won the wager.It is now, however, little more than from a foot and a half, to twofeet broad, excepting at the falls and <i>Devil&rsquo;s Hole</i>. Thewater runs into the Eden at the distance of about a mile or two fromStaincroft Bridge. Trout are caught with the line and net in greatquantities, and are particularly fine here.</p><p class="author">W.H.H.</p><br /><hr /><br /><h2>ANECDOTES OF A TAMED PANTHER.</h2><p class ="centre">B<small>Y</small> M<small>RS.</small> B<small>OWDICH</small>.</p><div class="note"><p>[Mrs. Bowdich is the widow of Mr. Thomas Edward Bowdich,  who fell a victim to his enterprize in exploring the  interior of Africa, in 1824. Mr. B. was a profound classic  and linguist and member of several learned societies in  England and abroad. In 1819 he published, in a quarto  volume, his &ldquo;Mission to Ashantee,&rdquo; a work of the highest  importance and interest. Mrs. B., whose pencil has  furnished embellishments for her husband&rsquo;s literary  productions, has published &ldquo;Excursions to Madeira, &amp;c.,&rdquo;  and this amiable and accomplished lady has now in course  of publication, a work on the Fresh-water Fishes of Great  Britain.&mdash;The subsequent anecdotes are of equal interest  to the student of natural history and the general reader,  especially as they exhibit the habits and disposition of  the Panther in a new light. The Ounce, a variety of the  Panther is, however, easily tamed and trained to the chase  of deer, the gazelle, &amp;c.&mdash;for which purpose it has long  been employed in the East, and also during the middle ages  in Italy and France.&mdash;Mr. Kean, the tragedian, a few years  since, had a tame <i>Puma</i>, or American Lion, which he  kept at his house in Clarges-street, Piccadilly, and  frequently introduced to large parties of company.&mdash;ED.]</p></div><p>I am induced to send you some account of a panther which wasin my possession for several months. He and another werefound when very young in the forest, apparently deserted bytheir mother. They were taken to the king of Ashantee, inwhose palace they lived several weeks, when my hero, beingmuch larger than his companion, suffocated him in a fit ofromping, and was then sent to Mr. Hutchison, the residentleft by Mr. Bowdich at Coomassie. This gentleman, observingthat the animal was very docile, took pains to tame him, andin a great measure succeeded. When he was about a year old,Mr. Hutchison returned to Cape Coast, and had him ledthrough the country by a chain, occasionally letting<span class="pagenum"><a id="page37" name="page37"></a>[pg37]</span>him loose when eating was going forward, when he would sitby his master&rsquo;s side, and receive his share with comparativegentleness. Once or twice he purloined a fowl, but easilygave it up to Mr. Hutchison, on being allowed a portion ofsomething else. The day of his arrival he was placed in asmall court, leading to the private rooms of the governor,and after dinner was led by a thin cord into the room, wherehe received our salutations with some degree of roughness,but with perfect good-humour. On the least encouragement helaid his paws upon our shoulders, rubbed his head upon us,and his teeth and claws having been filed, there was nodanger of tearing our clothes. He was kept in the abovecourt for a week or two, and evinced no ferocity, exceptwhen one of the servants tried to pull his food from him; hethen caught the offender by the leg, and tore out a piece offlesh, but he never seemed to owe him any ill-willafterwards. He one morning broke his cord, and, the crybeing given, the castle gates were shut, and a chasecommenced. After leading his pursuers two or three timesround the ramparts, and knocking over a few children bybouncing against them, he suffered himself to be caught, andled quietly back to his quarters, under one of the guns ofthe fortress.</p><p>By degrees the fear of him subsided, and orders having beengiven to the sentinels to prevent his escape through thegates, he was left at liberty to go where he pleased, and aboy was appointed to prevent him from intruding into theapartments of the officers. His keeper, however, generallypassed his watch in sleeping; and Sa&iuml;, as the panther wascalled, after the royal giver, roamed at large. On oneoccasion he found his servant sitting on the step of thedoor, upright, but fast asleep, when he lifted his paw, gavehim a blow on the side of his head which laid him flat, andthen stood wagging his tail, as if enjoying the mischief hehad committed. He became exceedingly attached to thegovernor, and followed him every-where like a dog. Hisfavourite station was at a window of the sitting-room, whichoverlooked the whole town; there, standing on his hind legs,his fore paws resting on the ledge of the window, and hischin laid between them, he appeared to amuse himself withwhat was passing beneath. The children also stood with himat the window; and one day, finding his presence anencumbrance, and that they could not get their chairs close,they used their united efforts to pull him down by the tail.He one morning missed the governor, who was settling adispute in the hall, and who, being surrounded by blackpeople, was hidden from the view of his favourite. Sa&iuml;wandered with a dejected look to various parts of thefortress in search of him; and, while absent on this errand,the audience ceased, the governor returned to his privaterooms, and seated himself at a table to write. Presently heheard a heavy step coming up the stairs, and, raising hiseyes to the open door, he beheld Sa&iuml;. At that moment he gavehimself up for lost, for Sa&iuml; immediately sprang from thedoor on to his neck. Instead, however, of devouring him, helaid his head close to the governor&rsquo;s, rubbed his cheek uponhis shoulder, wagged his tail, and tried to evince hishappiness. Occasionally, however, the panther caused alittle alarm to the other inmates of the castle, and thepoor woman who swept the floors, or, to speak technically,the <i>pra-pra</i> woman, was made ill by her fright. Shewas one day sweeping the boards of the great hall with ashort broom, and in an attitude nearly approaching toall-fours, and Sa&iuml;, who was hidden under one of the sofas,suddenly leaped upon her back, where he stood in triumph.She screamed so violently as to summon the other servants,but they, seeing the panther, as they thought, in the act ofswallowing her, one and all scampered off as quickly aspossible; nor was she released till the governor, who heardthe noise, came to her assistance. Strangers were naturallyuncomfortable when they saw so powerful a beast at perfectliberty, and many were the ridiculous scenes which tookplace, they not liking to own their alarm, yet perfectlyunable to retain their composure in his presence.</p><p>This interesting animal was well fed twice every day, butnever given any thing with life in it. He stood about twofeet high, and was of a dark yellow colour, thickly spottedwith black rosettes, and from the good feeding and the caretaken to clean him, his skin shone like silk. The expressionof his countenance was very animated and good-tempered, andhe was particularly gentle to children; he would lie down onthe mats by their side when they slept, and even the infantshared his caresses, and remained unhurt. During the periodof his residence at Cape Coast, I was much occupied bymaking arrangements for my departure from Africa, butgenerally visited my future companion every day, and we, inconsequence, became great friends before we sailed. He wasconveyed on board the vessel in a large, wooden cage,thickly barred in the front with iron.<span class="pagenum"><a id="page38" name="page38"></a>[pg38]</span> Even this confinement was not deemed a sufficient protection by the canoe men,<a href="#fn1"><sup>1</sup></a> <a name ="fn1ref"></a>who were so alarmed at taking him from the shore to the vessel, that, in their confusion, they dropped cage and all into the sea. For a few minutes I gave up my poor panther as lost, but some sailors jumped into a boat belonging to the vessel, and dragged him out in safety. The beast himself seemed completely subdued by his ducking, and as no one dared to open his cage to dry it, he rolled himself up in one corner, nor roused himself till after an interval of some days, when he recognised my voice. When I first spoke, he raised his head, held it on one side, then on the other, to listen; and when I came fully into his view, he jumped on his legs, and appeared frantic; he rolled himself over and over, he howled, he opened his enormous jaws and cried, and seemed as if he would have torn his cage to pieces. However, as his violence subsided, he contented himself with thrusting his paws and nose through the bars of the cage, to receive my caresses.</p><p>The greatest treat I could bestow upon my favourite waslavender water. Mr. Hutchison had told me that, on the wayfrom Ashantee, he drew a scented handkerchief from hispocket, which was immediately seized on by the panther, whoreduced it to atoms; nor could he venture to open a bottleof perfume when the animal was near, he was so eager toenjoy it. I indulged him twice a week by making a cup ofstiff paper, pouring a little lavender water into it, andgiving it to him through the bars of his cage: he would dragit to him with great eagerness, roll himself over it, norrest till the smell had evaporated. By this I taught him toput out his paws without showing his nails, always refusingthe lavender water till he had drawn them back again; and ina short time he never, on any occasion, protruded his clawswhen offering me his paw.</p><p>We lay eight weeks in the river Gaboon, where he had plentyof excellent food, but was never suffered to leave his cage,on account of the deck being always filled with blackstrangers, to whom he had a very decided aversion, althoughhe was perfectly reconciled to white people. Hisindignation, however, was constantly excited by the pigs,when they were suffered to run past his cage; and the sightof one of the monkeys put him in a complete fury. While atanchor in the before-mentioned river, an orang-outang (S&iacute;miaS&aacute;tyrus) was brought for sale, and lived three days onboard; and I shall never forget the uncontrollable rage ofthe one, or the agony of the other, at this meeting. Theorang was about three feet high, and very powerful inproportion to his size; so that when he fled withextraordinary rapidity from the panther to the further endof the deck, neither men nor things remained upright whenthey opposed his progress: there he took refuge in a sail,and although generally obedient to the voice of his master,force was necessary to make him quit the shelter of itsfolds. As to the panther, his back rose in an arch, his tailwas elevated and perfectly stiff, his eyes flashed, and, ashe howled, he showed his huge teeth; then, as if forgettingthe bars before him, he tried to spring on the orang, totear him to atoms. It was long before he recovered histranquillity; day and night he appeared to be on the listen;and the approach of a large monkey we had on board, or theintrusion of a black man, brought a return of his agitation.</p><p>We at length sailed for England, with an ample supply ofprovisions; but, unhappily, we were boarded by piratesduring the voyage, and nearly reduced to starvation. Mypanther must have perished had it not been for a collectionof more than three hundred parrots, with which we sailedfrom the river, and which died very fast while we were inthe northwest trades. Sa&iuml;&rsquo;s allowance was one per diem, butthis was so scanty a pittance that he became ravenous, andhad not patience to pick all the feathers off before hecommenced his meal. The consequence was, that he became veryill, and refused even this small quantity of food. Thosearound tried to persuade me that he suffered from the colderclimate; but his dry nose and paw convinced me that he wasfeverish, and I had him taken out of his cage; when, insteadof jumping about and enjoying his liberty, he lay down, andrested his head upon my feet. I then made him three pills,each containing two grains of calomel. The boy who had thecharge of him, and who was much attached to him, held hisjaws open, and I pushed the medicine down his throat. Earlythe next morning I went to visit my patient, and found hisguard sleeping in the cage with him; and having administereda further dose to the invalid, I had the satisfaction ofseeing him perfectly cured by the evening. On the arrival ofthe vessel in the London Docks, Sa&iuml; was taken ashore, andpresented to the Duchess of York, who placed him in ExeterChange, to be taken care of, till she herself went toOatlands. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="page39" name="page39"></a>[pg39]</span>remained there for some weeks, and was suffered to roam about thegreater part of the day without any restraint. On the morningprevious to the Duchess&rsquo;s departure from town, she went tovisit her new pet, played with him, and admired his healthyappearance and gentle deportment. In the evening, when her RoyalHighness&rsquo; coachman went to take him away, he was dead, inconsequence of an inflammation on his lungs&mdash;<i>Loudon&rsquo;sMagazine of Natural History.</i></p><br /><hr class="full" /><br /><h2>Manners &amp; Customs of all Nations</h2><h3>SACRAMENTAL BREAD.</h3><p>The church of Rome, in the height of its power, was extremelyscrupulous in all that related to the sacramental bread. Accordingto Steevens, in his <i>Monasticon</i>, they first chose the wheat,grain by grain, and washed it very carefully. Being put into a bag,appointed only for that use, a servant, known to be a just man,carried it to the mill, worked the grindstones, covering them withcurtains above and below; and having put on himself an albe, coveredhis face with a veil, nothing but his eyes appearing. The sameprecaution was used with the meal. It was not baked till it had beenwell washed; and the warden of the church, if he were either priestor deacon, finished the work, being assisted by two other religiousmen, who were in the same orders, and by a lay brother, particularlyappointed for that business. These four monks, when matins wereended, washed their faces and hands. The three first of them put onalbes; one of them washed the meal with pure, clean water, and theother two baked the hosts in the iron moulds. So great was theveneration and respect, say their historians, the monks of Clunipaid to the Eucharist! Even at this day, in the country, the bakerwho prepares the sacramental wafer, must be appointed and authorizedto do it by the Catholic bishop of the district, as appears by theadvertisement inserted in that curious book, published annually,<i>The Catholic Laity&rsquo;s Directory</i>.</p><br /><hr /><br /><h3> FOSTER CHILDREN.</h3><p> There still remains in the Hebrides, though it is passing fastaway, the custom of fosterage. A laird, a man of wealth andeminence, sends his child, either male or female, to a tacksman ortenant to be fostered. It is not always his own tenant, but somedistant friend that obtains this honour; for an honour such a trustis very reasonably thought. The terms of fosterage seem to vary indifferent islands. In Mull, the father sends with his child acertain number of cows, to which the same number is added by thefosterer. The father appropriates a proportionable extent of ground,without rent, for their pasturage. If every cow bring a calf, halfbelongs to the fosterer, and half to the child; but if there be onlyone calf between two cows, it is the child&rsquo;s; and when thechild returns to the parents, it is accompanied with all the cowsgiven, both by the father and by the fosterer, with half of theincrease of the stock by propagation. These beasts are considered asa portion, and called <i>Macalive</i> cattle, &amp;c.</p><p>Children continue with the fosterer perhaps six years; andcannot, where this is the practice, be considered as burdensome. Thefosterer, if he gives four cows, receives likewise four, and has,while the child continues with him, grass for eight without rent,with half the calves, and all the milk, for which he pays only fourcows, when he dismisses his <i>dalt</i>, for that is the name for afostered child.&mdash;<i>Johnson&rsquo;s Journey</i>.</p><br /><hr /><br /><h3> THE IRISH PEOPLE.</h3><p> Holinshed, speaking of the Irish, observes:&mdash;&ldquo;Greedyof praise they be, and fearful of dishonour; and to this end theyesteem their poets, who write Irish learnedly, and pen their sonnetsheroical, for the which they are bountifully rewarded; if not, theysend out libels in dispraise, whereof the lords and gentlemen standin great awe. They love tenderly their foster children, and bequeathto them a child&rsquo;s fortune, whereby they nourish surefriendship,&mdash;so beneficent every way, that commonly 500 cowsand better are given in reward to win a nobleman&rsquo;s child tofoster; they love and trust their foster children more than theirown. Proud they are of long crisped bushes of hair, which they term<i>libs</i>. They observe divers degrees, according to which eachman is regarded. The basest sort among them are little young wasps,called <i>daltins</i>: these are lacqueys, and are serviceable tothe grooms, or horseboys, who are a degree above the daltins. Thethird degree is the <i>kaerne</i>, which is an ordinary soldier,using for weapon his sword and target, and sometimes his piece,being commonly so good marksmen, as they will come within a score ofa great cartele. The fourth degree is a <i>gallowglass</i>, using akind of poll-axe for his weapon, strong, robust men, chiefly feedingon beef, pork, and butter. The fifth degree is to be a horseman,which is the <span class="pagenum"><a id="page40"name="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span> chiefest, next to the lord andcaptain. These horsemen, when they have no stay of their own, gadand range from house to house, and never dismount till they rideinto the hall, and as far as the tables.&rdquo;</p><br /><hr /><br /><h3>MARRIAGE.</h3><p>The minister of Logierait, in Perthshire, in his statisticalaccount of that parish, supplies us with the following curiousinformation on this and other marriageceremonies:&mdash;&ldquo;Immediately before the celebration of themarriage ceremony, every knot about the bride and bridegroom(garters, shoe-strings, strings of petticoats, &amp;c.) is carefullyloosed. After leaving the church, the whole company walk round it,keeping the church walls always upon the right hand; the bridegroom,however, first retires one way, with some young men, to tie theknots that were loosened about him, while the young married woman,in the same manner, retires somewhere else to adjust the disorder ofher dress.&rdquo;</p><br /><hr /><br /><h3>NEEDFIRE.</h3><p>The following extract contains a distinct and interesting accountof this very ancient superstition, as used in Caithness:</p><p>&ldquo;In 1788, when the stock of any considerable farmer wasseized with the murrain, he would send for one of the charm doctorsto superintend the raising of a <i>needfire</i>. It was done byfriction, thus: upon any small island, where the stream of a riveror burn ran on each side, a circular booth was erected, of stone andturf, as it could be had, in which a semicircular or highland coupleof birch, or other hard wood, was set; and, in short, a roof closedon it. A straight pole was set up in the centre of this building,the upper end fixed by a wooden pin to the top of the couple, andthe lower end in an oblong <i>trink</i> in the earth or floor; andlastly, another pole was set across horizontally, having both endstapered, one end of which was supported in a hole in the side of theperpendicular pole, and the other end in a similar hole in thecouple leg. The horizontal stick was called the auger, having fourshort arms or levers fixed in its centre, to work it by; thebuilding having been thus finished, as many men as could becollected in the vicinity, (being divested of all kinds of metal intheir clothes, &amp;c.) would set to work with the said auger, twoafter two, constantly turning it round by the arms or levers, andothers occasionally driving wedges of wood or stone behind the lowerend of the upright pole, so as to press it the more on the end ofthe auger; by this constant friction and pressure, the ends of theauger would take fire, from which a fire would be instantly kindled,and thus the <i>needfire</i> would be accomplished. The fire in thefarmer&rsquo;s house, &amp;c. was immediately quenched with water, afire kindled from this <i>needfire</i>, both in the farm-house andoffices, and the cattle brought to feel the smoke of this new andsacred fire, which preserved them from the murrain. So much forsuperstition.&mdash;It is handed down by tradition, that the ancientDruids superintended a similar ceremony of raising a sacred fire,annually, on the first day of May. That day is still, both in theGaelic and Irish dialects, called <i>L&#226;-bealtin, i.e.</i> the dayof Baal&rsquo;s fire, or the fire dedicated to Baal, or thesun.&rdquo;</p><br /><hr /><br /><h3> UNSPOKEN WATER</h3><p>In Scotland, water from under a bridge, over which the livingpass and the dead are carried, brought in the dawn or twilight tothe house of a sick person, without the bearer&rsquo;s speaking,either in going or returning, is called <i>Unspoken Water</i>.</p><p>The modes of application are various. Sometimes the invalid takesthree draughts of it before anything is spoken. Sometimes it isthrown over the houses the vessel in which it was contained beingthrown after it. The superstitious believe this to be one of themost powerful charms that can be employed for restoring a sickperson to health.</p><p>The purifying virtue attributed to water, by almost all nations,is so well known as to require no illustration. Some special virtuehas still been ascribed to silence in the use of charms, exorcisms,&amp;c. I recollect, says Mr. Jamieson, being assured at Angus, thata Popish priest in that part of the country, who was supposed topossess great power in curing those who were deranged, and inexorcising demoniacs, would, if called to see a patient, on noaccount utter a single word on his way, or after arriving at thehouse, till he had by himself gone through all his appropriate formsin order to effect a cure. Whether this practice might be founded onour Lord&rsquo;s injunction to the Seventy, expressive of thediligence he required, Luke x. 4, &ldquo;Salute no man by theway,&rdquo; or borrowed from heathen superstition, it is impossibleto ascertain. We certainly know that the Romans viewed silence as ofthe utmost importance in their sacred rites. Hence the phrase ofVirgil,&mdash;</p><div class="poem"><p>&ldquo;Fida silentia sacris.&rdquo;</p></div><p><i>Fauere sacris</i>, <i>fauere linguis</i>, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="page41" name="page41"></a>[pg41]</span> <i>pascere linguam</i>,were forms of speech appropriated to their sacred rites, by whichthey enjoined silence, that the act of worship might not bedisturbed by the slightest noise or murmur. Hence also they honouredHarpocrates as the god of silence; and Numa instituted the worshipof a goddess under the name of <i>Tacita</i>.</p><br /><hr class="full" /><br /><h2>SPIRIT OF DISCOVERY</h2><h3>FILTERING APPARATUS.</h3><p class="centre"><i><big>(To the Editor of the Mirror.)</big></i></p><div class="figure" style="width: 80%;"><a href="images/323-2.png"><img width="40%" src="images/323-2.png" alt="Filtering Apparatus" /></a></div><p class="centre">A A. <i>The Pot.</i> B B.&nbsp;<i>The Triangular Board.</i> C. <i>The Cover.</i>D. <i>Vessel to receive the Filtered Water.</i><br />E. <i>Dotted Line, showing the Proportion of Charcoal and Sand.</i></p><p>Herewith I send you an outline drawing of an economical filteringapparatus, suitable for the use of any dwelling. Its construction isperfectly simple, and at the cost of a few shillings in itserection. The pot consists of an unglazed inverted vessel,manufactured at potteries for the use of sugar-bakers, and placedthrough a hole in a triangular board, resting upon two ledges,occupying a corner in a kitchen or any other apartment. In theinside of the pot a bushel of the whitest sand is to be introduced;which sand, after being washed in a clean tub with about threechanges of water, to dissolve and clear away the clayey matter, isto be mixed with half a peck of finely-bruised charcoal. This willfill about one-third of the pot; but before the sand is placed inthe vessel, the small hole at the bottom of the pot should have anoyster-shell placed over it, with the convex side uppermost, toprevent the sand washing through. This filters foul water perfectlypellucid and clear very quickly, as I have seen its effects foryears with the most perfect success. When the sand becomes foul bytime, it can be taken out and washed, or fresh materials can berepeated; great care should be observed not to put more water in thepot than your vessel underneath will receive.</p><p class="author">JNO. FIELD.</p><hr /><br /><h3>Effects of Lightning.</h3><p>The analogy between the electric spark, and more especially of theexplosive discharge of the Leyden jar, with atmospheric lightningand thunder, is too obvious to have escaped notice, even in theearly periods of electrical research. It had been observed by Dr.Wall and by Gray, and still more pointedly remarked by the Abb&eacute;Nollet. Dr. Franklin was so impressed with the many points ofresemblance between lightning and electricity, that he was convincedof their identity, and determined to ascertain by direct experimentthe truth of his bold conjecture. A spire which was erecting atPhiladelphia he conceived might assist him in this inquiry; but,while waiting for its completion, the sight of a boy&rsquo;s kite, whichhad been raised for amusement, immediately suggested to him a moreready method of attaining his object. Having constructed a kite bystretching a large silk handkerchief over two sticks in the form ofa cross, on the first appearance of an approaching storm, in June1752, he went out into a field, accompanied by his son, to whomalone he had imparted his design. Having raised his kite, andattached a key to the lower end of the hempen string, he insulatedit by fastening it to a post, by means of silk, and waited withintense anxiety for the result. A considerable time elapsed withoutthe apparatus giving any sign of electricity, even although a densecloud, apparently charged with lightning, had passed over the spoton which they stood. Franklin was just beginning to despair ofsuccess, when his attention was caught by the bristling up of someloose fibres on the hempen cord; he immediately presented hisknuckle to the key, and received an electric spark. Overcome withthe emotion<span class="pagenum"><a id="page42" name="page42"></a>[pg42]</span>inspired by this decisive evidence of the great discovery he hadachieved, he heaved a deep sigh, and conscious of an immortal name,felt that he could have been content if that moment had been hislast. The rain now fell in torrents, and wetting the string,rendered it conducting in its whole length; so that electric sparkswere now collected from it in great abundance.</p><p>It should be noticed, however, that about a month before Franklinhad made these successful trials, some philosophers, in particularDalibard and De Lors, had obtained similar results in France, byfollowing the plan recommended by Franklin. But the glory of thediscovery is universally given to Franklin, as it was from hissuggestions that the methods of attaining it were originallyderived.</p><p>This important discovery was prosecuted with great ardour byphilosophers in every part of Europe. The first experimentersincurred considerable risk in their attempts to draw downelectricity from the clouds, as was soon proved by the fatalcatastrophe, which, on the 6th of August, 1753, befel ProfessorRichman, of Petersburg. He had constructed an apparatus forobservations on atmospherical electricity, and was attending ameeting of the Academy of Sciences, when the sound of distantthunder caught his ear. He immediately hastened home, taking withhim his engraver, Sokolow, in order that he might delineate theappearances that should present themselves. While intent uponexamining the electrometer, a large globe of fire flashed from theconducting rod, which was insulated, to the head of Richman, andpassing through his body, instantly deprived him of life. A red spotwas found on his forehead, where the electricity had entered, hisshoe was burst open, and part of his clothes singed. His companionwas struck down, and remained senseless for some time; the door-caseof the room was split, and the door itself torn off its hinges.</p><p>The protection of buildings from the effects of lightning, is themost important practical application of the theory of electricity.Conductors for this should be formed of metallic rods, pointed atthe upper extremity, and placed so as to project a few feet abovethe highest part of the building they are intended to secure; theyshould be continued without interruption till they descend into theground, below the foundation of the house. Copper is preferable toiron as the material for their construction, being less liable todestruction by rust, or by fusion, and possessing also a greaterconducting power. The size of the rods should be from half an inchto an inch in diameter, and the point should be gilt, or made ofplatina, that it may be more effectually preserved from corrosion.An important condition in the protecting conductor is, that nointerruption should exist in its continuity from top to bottom; andadvantage will result from connecting together by strips of metalall the leaden water pipes, or other considerable masses of metal inor about the building, so as to form one continuous system ofconductors, for carrying the electricity by different channels tothe ground. The lower end of the conductors should be carried downinto the earth till it reaches either water, or at least a moiststratum.&mdash;<i>Library of Useful Knowledge.</i></p><br /><hr class="full" /><br /><h2>The Sketch-Book.</h2><hr /><h3>THE MYSTERIOUS TAILOR.</h3><p class="centre"><i>A Romance of High Holborn.</i></p><p>It came to pass that, towards the close of 1826, I found occasionto change my tailor, and by chance, or the recommendation offriends&mdash;I cannot now remember which&mdash;applied to one whovegetated in that particular region of the metropolis where therivers of Museum-street and Drury-lane (to adopt the language ofmetaphor) flow into and form the capacious estuary of High Holborn.Whoever has sailed along, or cast anchor in this confluence, musthave seen the individual I allude to. He sits&mdash;I should perhapssay sat, inasmuch as he is since defunct&mdash;bolt upright, with apen behind his ear, in the centre of a dingy, spectral-looking shop,quaintly hung round with clothes, of divers forms and patterns, inevery stage of existence&mdash;from the first crude conception ofthe incipient surtout or pantaloons, down to the last glorious touchthat immortalizes the artist. His figure is slim and undersized; hischeeks are sallow, with two furrows on each side his nose, fillednot unfrequently with snuff; his eyes project like lobsters&rsquo;,and cast their shifting glances about with a vague sort ofmysterious intelligence; and his voice&mdash;his startling, solemn,unearthly voice&mdash;seems hoarse with sepulchral vapours, and putsforth its tones like the sighing of the wind among tombs. Withregard to his dress, it is in admirable keeping with hiscountenance. He wears a black coat, fashioned in the mould of othertimes, with large cloth buttons and flowing skirts; drabinexpressibles, fastened at the knee with brass buckles; gaiters,which, reaching no higher than<span class="pagenum"><a id="page43" name="page43"></a>[pg43]</span>the calf of the leg, set up independent claims to eccentricity andexact consideration on their own account; creaking, square-toedshoes; and a hat, broad in front, pinched up at the sides, vergingto an angle behind, and worn close over the forehead, with the lowerpart resting on the nose. His manner is equally peculiar; it cannotbe called vulgar, nor yet genteel&mdash;for it is too passive forthe one, and too pompous for the other; it forms, say, a sort ofcompromise between the two, with a slight infusion of pedantry thatgreatly adds to its effect. </p><p> On reaching this oddity&rsquo;s abode, I at once proceeded tobusiness; and was promised, in reply, the execution of my order onthe customary terms of credit. Thus far is strictly natural. Theclothes came home, and so, with admirable punctuality, did the bill;but the death of a valued friend having withdrawn me, soonafterwards, from London, six months elapsed; at the expiration ofwhich time I was refreshed, as agreed on, by a pecuniary applicationfrom my tailor. Perhaps I should here mention, to the betterunderstanding of my tale, that I am a medical practitioner, ofsomewhat nervous temperament, derived partly from inheritance, andpartly from an inveterate indulgence of the imagination. My income,too&mdash;which seldom or never encumbers a surgeon who has not yetdone walking the hospitals&mdash;is limited, and, at this presentperiod, was so far contracted as to keep me in continual suspense.In this predicament my tailor&rsquo;s memorandum was any thing butsatisfactory. I wrote accordingly to entreat his forbearance for sixmonths longer, and, as I received no reply, concluded that all wassatisfactorily arranged. Unluckily, however, as I was strolling,about a month afterwards, along the Strand, I chanced to stumble upagainst him. The shock seemed equally unexpected on both sides; butmy tailor (as being a dun) was the first to recover self-possession;and, with a long preliminary hem!&mdash;a mute, but expressivecompound of remonstrance, apology, and resolution&mdash;opened hisfire as follows:&mdash; </p><p>&ldquo;I believe, sir, your name is D&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe it is, sir.&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, touching that littleaccount between us, I have to request, sir, that&mdash;&rdquo; </p><p>&ldquo;Very good; nothing can be more reasonable; wait theappointed time, and you shall have all.&rdquo; </p><p> This answer served, in some degree, to appease him; no, notexactly to appease him, because that would imply previousexcitement, and he was invariably imperturbable in manner; itsatisfied him, however, for the present, and he forthwith walkedaway, casting on me that equivocal sort of look with which Ajaxturned from Ulysses, or Dido from &AElig;neas, in the Shades. </p><p> A lapse of a few weeks ensued, during which I heard nothingfurther from my persecutor; when, one dark Novemberevening&mdash;one of those peculiarly English evenings, full of fogand gloom, when the half-frozen sleet, joined in its descent bygutters from the house-tops, comes driving full in your face,blinding you to all external objects&mdash;on one of these blessedevenings, on my road to Camden Town, I chanced to miss my way, andwas compelled, notwithstanding a certain shyness towards strangers,to ask my direction of the first respectable person I should meet.Many passed me by, but none sufficiently prepossessing; when, onturning down some nameless street that leads to TottenhamCourt-road, I chanced to come behind a staid-looking gentleman,accoutred in a dark brown coat, with an umbrella&mdash;the cotton ofwhich had shrunk half-way up the whalebone&mdash;held obliquely overhis head. Hastily stepping up to him, &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; saidI, &ldquo;could you be kind enough to direct me to &mdash;&mdash;place, Camden Town?&rdquo; </p><p> The unknown, thus addressed, made the slightest possibleinclination towards me; and then, in an under tone, &ldquo;Ibelieve, sir, your name is D&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; </p><p> I paused; a vague sort of recollection came over me. Could itbe?&mdash;no, surely not! And yet the voice&mdash;themanner&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash; </p><p> My suspicions were soon converted into certainty, when thestranger, with his own peculiar expression, quietly broke forth asecond time with, &ldquo;Touching that little account&mdash;&rdquo;</p><p> This was enough; it was more than enough&mdash;it wasvexatiously superfluous. To be dunned for a debt, at the very timewhen the nerves could best dispense with the application; to berecalled back to the vulgarities of existence, at that precisemoment when the imagination was most abstracted from all commercialcommon-places; to be stopped by a tailor, (and such a tailor!) whenthe mind was dreaming of a mistress&mdash;the bare idea wasintolerable! So I thought; and, without further explanation, hurriedprecipitately from the spot, nor ever once paused till far removedfrom the husky tones of that sepulchral voice which had once beforeso highly excited my annoyance. </p><p> [The narrater then visits one of Mr. Champagne Wright&rsquo;smasquerades, where he falls in love with a <i>fresco</i> nun. Hereceives a billet.] </p><p> <span class="pagenum"><a id="page44" name="page44"></a>[pg44]</span>I stood like one bewildered; but, soon recovering myself-possession, moved direct towards the chandelier, with a view toperuse an epistle expressive of woman&rsquo;s fondest love. As withglistening eyes I proceeded to tear open the billet, a flood oftransporting thoughts swept over me. I fancied that I was on the eveof acquaintance with &mdash;&mdash;; but, judge my astonishment,when, instead of the expected document, the key to such transportingbliss, I read, engraved in large German text, on a dirty squarecard, embossed at the edge with flowers, the revolting,business-like address of </p><div class="figure" style="width:60%;"><a href="images/323-3.png"><img width="60%" src="images/323-3.png" alt="Calling card" /></a></div><p> It so happened that, the next day, I dined with C&mdash;&mdash;.Of course the masquerade, and with that the tailor, were the firsttopics of conversation between us. Both allowed that thecircumstances respecting his late appearance were uncommon; butthere, with my friend, the matter ended: with me it was a moreenduring subject for reflection; and, after a night kept up till alate hour over a bowl of C&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;s most faultless punch, Iset out, moody and apprehensive, to my humble abode. By this time itwas past three o&rsquo;clock; the streets were nearly all deserted.&mdash;While thoughtfully plodding onwards, a sudden noise from theHolborn end of Drury-lane took my attention; it evidently proceededfrom a row&mdash;a systematic, scientific row; and, indeed, as Idrew near the scene of action, I could distinctly hear thewatchman&rsquo;s oaths blending in deep chorus with the treble of somedozen or two valorous exquisites. </p><p> I felt certain rising abstract ideas of pugnacity, and conceivedmyself bound to indulge them on the first head and shoulders Ishould meet. This spirit brought me at once into the thick of thefight, and, before I was well aware of my proximity, I found myselffast anchored alongside a veteran watchman, with a pigtail and halfa nose. The conflict now commenced in good earnest; there were fewor no attempts at favouritism; the blows of one friend told equallywell on the scull of another; watchman assaulted watchman with azeal respectable for its sincerity; and, indeed, had these last beenany thing more than a bundle of old coats and oaths, they would mostundoubtedly have drubbed each other into a better world. After alively and well-sustained affair of about twenty minutes, a squadronof auxiliary watchmen arrived, and, with some difficulty, depositedus all safely in the watch-house. And here the very first personthat met my gaze&mdash;seated, with due regard to dignity, in anarm-chair, a pair of spectacles on his nose, a glass ofbrandy-and-water by his side, and a newspaper, redolent of cheese,before him&mdash;was the constable of the night&mdash;the nun of themasquerade&mdash;the Mysterious Tailor of High Holborn! Thewretch&rsquo;s eyes gleamed with a savage but subdued joy at therecognition; a low, chuckling laugh escaped him; while his dullcountenance, made doubly revolting by the dim light of thewatch-house, fell, fixed and scowling, upon me, as he pointedtowards the spot where I stood.&mdash;&ldquo;Dobson,&rdquo; heexclaimed; and, at the word, forth stepped the owner of thismelodious appellative, with &ldquo;this here man.&rdquo;&mdash;Luckily, before he could finish his charge, afive-shilling-piece, which I thrust into his unsuspecting palm,created a diversion among the watchmen in my behalf; under favour ofwhich, while my arch enemy was adjusting his books, I contrived toescape from his detested presence. </p><p> It happened that about a month subsequent to this lastrencontre, circumstances led me to Bologne, whither I arrived, latein the evening, by the steamboat. On being directed to the bestEnglish hotel in that truly social Anglo-Gallic little town, Ichanced to find in the coffee-room an old crony, whom I had knownyears since at Cambridge, and who had just arrived from Switzerland,on a speculation connected with some vineyards. </p><p> I had a thousand questions to ask my friend, a thousand memoriesto disinter from their graves in my heart, past follies to re-enact,past scenes to re-people. We began with our school-days, pursued thesubject to Cambridge, carried it back again to Reading, and thencetraced it through all its windings, now in sunshine, now in gloom,till the canvass of our recollection was fairly filled withportraits. In this way, time, unperceived, slipped on; noon deepenedinto evening, evening blackened into midnight, yet nothing but ourwine was exhausted. </p><p> At last, after a long evening spent in the freest and mostsocial converse, my friend quitted the coffee-room, whileI&mdash;imitating, as I went, the circumlocutory windings of theMeander&mdash;proceeded to my allotted chamber. Unfortunately, onreaching the head of the first staircase, where two opposite doorspresented themselves, I opened (as a matter of course) the wrongone, which led me into a spacious apartment, in which were placedtwo fat, full-grown beds. My lantern happening to go out at themoment, I <span class="pagenum"><a id="page45" name="page45"></a>[pg45]</span> was compelled to forego all further scrutiny, so withoutmore ado, flung off my clothes, and dived, at one dexterous plunge,right into the centre of the nearest vacant bed. In an instant I wasfast asleep; my imagination, oppressed with the day&rsquo;s events,hadbecome fairly exhausted, and I now lay chained down in that heavy,dreamless sleep, which none but fatigued travellers can appreciate.Towards daybreak, I was roused by a peculiar long-drawn snore,proceeding from the next bed. The music, though deep, was gusty,vulgar, and ludicrous, like a west wind whistling through awash-house. I should know it among a thousand snores. At first Itook no notice of this diversified sternutation, but as it deepenedevery moment in energy, terminating in something like a groan, I wascompelled to pay it the homage of my admiration and astonishment.This attention, however, soon flagged; in a few minutes I was asecond time asleep, nor did I again awake till the morning was faradvanced. At this eventful juncture, while casting my eyes round theroom with all the voluptuous indolence of a jaded traveller, theysuddenly chanced to fall on a gaunt, spectral figure, undressed,unwashed, unshaved, decked out in a red worsted night-cap, its leftcheek swollen, as if with cold or tooth-ache, and seated boltupright in the very next bed, scarce six inches off my nose. Andthis figure was&mdash;&mdash;but I need add no more; the reader mustby this time have fully anticipated my discovery. </p><p> That night I started from Bologne. I could no more have enduredto stop there, conscious that the town contained my persecutor, thanI could have flown. Accordingly, after a hurried breakfast, Iproceeded to arrange what little business I had to transact; andthis completed, away I posted to the well-known shop of Monsieur&mdash;&mdash;, dentist, perruquier, and general agent to thesteam-packet company. Fortunately the little man was at home, andreceived me with his usual courtesy. He was very, very sorry that hecould not stay to converse with me, but a patient in the innerparlour required his immediate attendance; he musttherefore&mdash;. I entreated him not to apologize; mybusiness was simple&mdash;it was merely to ascertain at what hourthe first packet sailed; and having so said, and received asatisfactory reply, I prepared to quit the shop, when just as I wasturning round to shut the door, I caught a glimpse through thehalf-closed curtains that shaded the inner room of a cheek and oneeye. The cheek was swollen, and a solitary patch of snuff rested,like a fly, upon its surface. It was the Mysterious Tailor; he hadcome in to have his tooth pulled out. </p><p> Notwithstanding my anxiety to quit Bologne, it was eveningbefore I was on board the packet; nor did I feel myself at ease,until the heights had dwindled to a speck, and the loud carols ofthe fishermen returning home from their day&rsquo;s sport, had sunkinto a faint, undistinguished whisper. Our vessel&rsquo;s course forthe first hour or so was delightful. Towards night, the weather,which had hitherto proved so serene, began to fluctuate; the windshifted, and gradually a heavy swell came rolling in from thenorth-east towards us. As the hour advanced, a storm seemedadvancing with it; and a hundred symptoms appeared, the least ofwhich was fully sufficient to certify the coming on of a tremendoushurricane. Our captain, however&mdash;a bronzed, pinched-up littlefellow, whom a series of north-westers seemed to have dried to amummy&mdash;put a good face on the matter, and our mate whistledbluffly, though I could not help fancying that his whistle hadsomething forced about it. </p><p> We had by this time been tossing about upwards of four hours,yet despite the storm, which increased every moment in energy, ourvessel bore up well, labouring and pitching frightfully to be sure,but as yet uninjured in sail, mast, or hull. As for her course, itwas&mdash;so the mate assured me&mdash;&ldquo; a moral impossible tosay which way we were bound, whether for a trip to Spain, Holland,or Van Dieman&rsquo;s Land; it might be one, it might bet&rsquo;other.&rdquo; Scarcely had he uttered these words, when along rolling sea came sweeping on in hungry grandeur towards us, andat one rush tore open the ship&rsquo;s gun-wale, which now,completely at the mercy of the wave, went staggering, drunken, andblindfold, through the surge. From this fatal moment the sailorswere kept constantly at the pumps, although so instantaneous was therush of water into the hold, that they did little or no good; thereseemed, in fact, not the ghost of a chance left us; even the matehad ceased whistling, and the captain&rsquo;s oaths began to assumethe nature of a compromise between penitence and hardihood. </p><p> It was now midnight, deep, awful midnight; the few remainingpassengers had left the deck and retreated into a bed which theyshared in common with the salt water. The Captain stood, like onebewildered, beside the helm, while I lay stretched along theforecastle, watching, as well as I could, the tremendous rushing ofthe waves. It was during a partial hush of the storm, when the wind,as if out of breath, was still, that a shifting <spanclass="pagenum"><a id="page46" name="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>light attached to some moving body, came bearing down full uponus.</p><p>&ldquo;This is an ugly night, sir,&rdquo; said the Captain, whonow, for the first time, found words, &ldquo;yet methinks I see asail a-head.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Surely not,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;no earthly vessel butour own can live on such a sea.&rdquo;</p><p>Scarcely had the words escaped me, when &ldquo;helm a lee!&rdquo;was roared out in a loud emphatic tone, something between rage andfright.</p><p>The captain strove to turn his helm, but in vain, the rudder hadlost all power. At this instant, a rushing sound swept past us, andthe two ships came in direct contact with each other. The crash wastremendous: down with a dizzy spinning motion went the strangevessel; one yell&mdash;but one shrill piercing yell, which is eversounding in my ears, ensued&mdash;a pause, and all was over. </p><p>My heart died within me at that cry; an icy shudder crept throughme, every hair of my head seemed endowed with separate vitality. Togo down into the tomb&mdash;and such a tomb!&mdash;unwept, unknown,the very lights from the English coast still discernible indistance, yet not a friend to hold forth aid; the idea wasinexpressibly awful. Just at this crisis, while grasping thebannister with weak hands, I lay faint and hopeless on the deck, Ifancied I saw a dark figure crawling up the cabin-steps towards me.I listened; the sound drew near, the form advanced, already ittouched that part of the staircase to which I clung. Was it thephantom of one of those wretches who had just met death? Had it comefresh from eternity, the taint of recent earth yet hanging about it,to warn me of my own departure? A sudden vivid flash enabled me todispel all doubt; the dull, grey eye, and thin furrowed form, werenot to be so mistaken; the voice too&mdash;but why prolong themystery? it was my old unforgotten persecutor, the Mysterious Tailorof High Holborn. What followed I know not: overpowered by previousexcitement, and the visitation of this infernal phantom, my brainspun round&mdash;my heart ticked audibly like a clock&mdash;mytongue glued to my mouth&mdash;I sank senseless at the cabindoor.</p><p class="author"><i>(To be concluded in our next.)</i></p><br /><hr class="full" /><h2>SPIRIT OF THE PUBLIC JOURNALS</h2><hr /><h3>NORFOLK

READER</h2><hr /><h4>DUELLING.</h4><p> Two French officers resident at Kermanshaw, lately quarrelled; achallenge ensued; but a reconciliation was effected; when theincident drew forth the following natural and affecting remark froma native:&mdash;&ldquo;How foolish it is for a man who wishes tokill his enemy, to expose his own life, when he can accomplish hispurpose with so much greater safety, by shooting at him from behinda rock.&rdquo; </p><hr /><h4>SPINNING VIRTUE.</h4><p> A young preacher, who chose to enlarge to a country congregationon the beauty of <i>virtue</i>, was surprised to be informed of anold woman, who expressed herself highly pleased with his sermon,that her daughter was the most <i>virtuous</i> woman in the parish,for &ldquo;that week she had spun sax spyndles ofyarn.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Sir W. Scott</i>. </p><hr /><h4>AT LINCOLN</h4><p>There is a beautiful painted window, which was made by anapprentice, out of the pieces of glass which had been rejected byhis master. It is so far superior to every other in the church,that, according to the tradition, the vanquished artist killedhimself from mortification.</p><hr /><p> A great lawyer in the sister kingdom, when asked by the viceroy,what Captain Keppel meant by his &ldquo;<i>Personal</i> Travels inIndia, &amp;c.&rdquo; replied, that lawyers were wont to use thisword in contradistinction to &ldquo;<i>Real</i>.&rdquo; </p><hr /><p>It is said that the intestines of the Carolina parrot are aninstantaneous poison to cats.</p><hr /><h4>CHINESE DUNNING.</h4><p>When a debtor refuses payment in China, the creditor, as a lastresource, threatens to carry off the door of his house on the firstday of the year. This is accounted the greatest misfortune thatcould happen, as in that case there would be no obstruction to theentrance of evil genii. To avoid this consummation, a debtor notunfrequently sets fire to his house on the last night of theyear.</p><hr /><p>During the times of Catholicism in Scotland, <i>Fishing</i> wasprohibited from the Sabbath after vespers, till Monday aftersunrise. This was termed <i>Setterday&rsquo;s Slopp</i>.</p><hr /><h4>THE TOWER OF BABEL,</h4><p>says a recent traveller in the east, now presents the appearanceof a large mound or hill, with a castle on the top, in mounting towhich, the traveller now and then discovers, through the light sandysoil, that he is treading on a vast heap of bricks. The totalcircumference of the ruin is 2,286 feet, though the building itselfwas only 2,000, allowing 500 to the stadia, which Herodotus assignsas the side of its square. The elevation of the west side is 198feet. What seems to be a castle at a distance, when examined, provesto be a solid mass of kiln-burnt bricks, 37 feet high, and 28broad.</p><hr /><h4>SPANISH LITERATURE.</h4><p>The Spaniards are particularly averse to borrowing from theintellectual treasures of other nations. They glean the field oftheir own muses to the very last ear, and then commence the samelabour over again.</p><hr /><h4>EVERY MAN HIS OWN LAWYER.</h4><p> Here is a well-turned reply to plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel,available in all suits and times. It occurred in the trial of LordDanby, in the time of Charles II. &ldquo;If the gentleman were asjust to produce all he knows for me, as he hath been malicious toshow what may be liable to misconstruction against me, no man couldvindicate me more than myself.&rdquo; </p><hr /><p>In modern education there is a lamentable lack of veneration forthe great masters of English literature. Spenser, Milton, and Drydenare altogether less familiar to the present generation than theywere to that which preceded it. &ldquo;We will not say that ourShakspeare is neglected, for his age is ever fresh and green, and hecomes reflected back to us from a thousand sources, whether in thetranquillity of home, the turbulent life of capitals<spanclass="pagenum"><a id="page48" name="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>, orthe solitude of travel through distant lands.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Edin.Rev.</i></p><hr /><h4>RISE AND FALL.</h4><p> What an idea of the dismantling of our nature do the few wordswhich Roper, Sir Thomas More&rsquo;s son-in-law, relates, convey! He hadseen Henry VIII. walking round the chancellor&rsquo;s garden at Chelsea,with his arm round his neck; he could not help congratulating him onbeing the object of so much kindness. &ldquo;I thank our lord, Ifind his grace my very good lord indeed; and I believe he doth assingularly favour me as any subject in his realm. However, sonRoper, I may tell thee, I have no cause to be proud thereof, for ifmy head would win a castle in France, it would not fail to be struckoff.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></p><hr /><p>There is not only room, but use, for all that God has made in hiswisdom&mdash;a use not the less real, because not always tangible, orimmediate.&mdash;<i>Ibid.</i></p><hr /><p>Nicholas Brady, (the coadjutor of Tate, in arranging the New Versionof Psalms,) published a translation of the &AElig;neid of Virgil,which (says Johnson,) when dragged into the world, did not live longenough to cry.</p><hr /><p>Blue appears to be the most important of all colours in thegradations of society. A licensed beggar in Scotland, called abedesmen, is so privileged on receiving a <i>blue</i> gown. Plinyinforms us that blue was the colour in which the Gauls clothed theirslaves; and <i>blue</i> coats, for many ages, were the liveries ofservants, apprentices, and even of younger brothers, as now of theBlue Coat Boys, and of other Blue Schools in the country. Women usedto do penance in <i>blue</i> gowns. Is it not unseemly that bluewhich has hitherto been the colour of so many unenviabledistinctions, should be the adopted emblem ofliberty&mdash;<i>English True Blue</i>!</p><hr  /><h3>SONG.</h3><h4>By JOANNA BAILLIE.</h4><div class="poem"><p>The gliding fish that takes his play</p><p class="i2"> In shady nook of streamlet cool, </p><p>Thinks not how waters pass away,</p><p class="i2"> And summer dries the pool.</p><p class="stanza">The bird beneath his leafy dome</p><p class="i2">Who trills his carol, loud and clear,</p><p>Thinks not how soon his verdant home</p><p class="i2">The lightning&rsquo;s breath may sear.</p><p class="stanza">Shall I within my bridegroom&rsquo;s bower</p><p class="i2">With braids of budding roses twined,</p><p>Look forward to a coming hour</p><p class="i2">When he may prove unkind?</p><p class="stanza">The bee reigns in his waxen cell,</p><p class="i2">The chieftain in his stately hold,</p><p>To-morrow&rsquo;s earthquake,&mdash;who can tell?</p><p class="i2">May both in ruin fold.</p></div><hr /><h2>The Gatherer.</h2><p class="centre">&ldquo;A snapper-up of unconsidered trifles.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Shakspeare</i>.</p><hr /><h4>CATS <i>(again.)</i></h4><p>Charles James Fox walking up Bond-street from one of the club-houseswith an illustrious personage, laid him a wager, that he would seemore cats than the prince in his walk, and that he might take whichside of the street he liked. When they got to the top, it was foundthat Mr. Fox had seen thirteen cats, and the prince not one. Theroyal personage asked for an explanation of this apparent miracle;Mr. Fox said, &ldquo;Your royal highness took, of course, the shadyside of the way, as most agreeable; I knew that the sunny side wouldbe left for me, and cats always prefer the sunshine.&rdquo;</p><hr /><h4>VAUXHALL WEATHER.</h4><p>It having happened for several successive summers, that wet weathertook place just as the Vauxhall season commenced, Tom Lowe, Tyers&rsquo;sprincipal vocal performer, accidentally meeting the proprietor,expressed an anxious desire to know when he meant to open hisgardens. &ldquo;Why are you so particular, Mr. Lowe?&rdquo; saidJonathan. &ldquo;I have a very good reason, sir, and should like toknow the very day.&rdquo; &ldquo;Why, why?&rdquo; reiterated Tyers,impatiently. &ldquo;That I may bespeak a great coat to sing in; foryou know we shall be sure to have rain.&rdquo;"</p><hr /><h4>LAME SINGING.</h4><p>A few days since, a musicsellers&rsquo;s boy was sent to thepublisher&rsquo;s for a number of copies of the song &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be aButterfly, arranged for <i>two trebles;</i>&rdquo; when, on beingdesired to repeat his order, he replied, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be a Butterfly,arranged for <i>two cripples.</i>&rdquo;</p><hr /><h4>LAUGHTER.</h4><p>Democritus, who was always laughing, lived one hundred and nineyears; Heraclitus, who never ceased crying, only sixty.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
